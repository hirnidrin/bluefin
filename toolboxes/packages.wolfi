# The initial 'distrobox enter wolfi' command invokes https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/distrobox-init
# which installs many basic packages and distrobox deps (starts at about line 410+ for the bash shell).
# So there is no need to pre-install duplicate dependency packages here that possibly induce conflicts.
